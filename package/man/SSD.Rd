\title{SSD = sample size determination}
\usage{
SSD(BFDA, boundary = c(1/3, 3), power = 0.9, alpha = 0.025,
  plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{BFDA}{A BFDA simulation object, resulting from the \code{BFDA.sim} function}

\item{boundary}{The critical boundary that defines the "success" of a study. This can be a single value, for example 1. In this case, all studies with BF < 1 are counted as "negative outcomes", and BF > 1 as positive outcomes (i.e., it quantifies the probability of getting a BF with the correct direction).}

\item{power}{The desired rate of true-positive results (in case of reality=H1)}

\item{alpha}{The desired rate of false-positive results (in case of reality=H0)}

\item{plot}{Display plot? (TRUE/FALSE)}
}
